# Data Science Project Showcase:

Welcome to my GitHub profile. This is the main page and folder that will hold most of my showcase projects. These projects will be used to demonstrate my skills as a Data Scientist in handling and tackling different types of (Data) problems, for academic, self-learning, and work purposes. These projects will be presented in the form of iPython Notebooks coupled with supporting ".py" files.
Below is a chart showing the projects available to view and its short description. There will be links provided for navigation to each individual project. 

### Overview of the Projects for Showcase:

### Links to the Showcase Projects:
1. 	[Employee Attrition](DataScience_Projects/Project 1 - Employee Attrition at main · ylee9107/DataScience_Projects (github.com)) A fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists consisting of employee data for the development of a model that lowers the costs associated with hiring and training employees.
2. 	[Customer Behaviour (Credit Card)](DataScience_Projects/Project 2 - Customer Behaviour_CreditCards at main · ylee9107/DataScience_Projects (github.com)) Analysing a dataset containing data on various customers' bi-annual spending behaviour that are reported in monetary units. A clustering model was built to simplify and discover the internal structure, distributions and patterns of the data to produce suggestions for a marketing campaign.
3.  	[Disease Detection (Covid-19)](DataScience_Projects/Project 3 - Disease Detection_COVID19 at main · ylee9107/DataScience_Projects (github.com)) Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet-50) that learns to recognise a curated medical dataset consisting of Normal, Covid-19, Viral and Bacterial Pneumonia X-rays records.
4. 	[Under-priced Apartment Listings](DataScience_Projects/Project 4 - Underpriced Apartment Listings at main · ylee9107/DataScience_Projects (github.com)) Designed a machine learning application that utilises a Regression model to predict prices of apartments in New York based on their location, where the data was scraped off an apartment listings website.
5. 	[GitHub Account Recommender](DataScience_Projects/Project 5 - Recommendation Engine_GithubProfiles at main · ylee9107/DataScience_Projects) Designed a recommendation engine for GitHub Accounts based on a collaborative filtering model. The model utilises my previously starred GitHub repositories of interest and recommends new accounts that are similar. I was able to use this model to collect more relevant repositories for my learning journey.

### My Learning Projects for Skill Improvement:

Aside from the 4 showcase projects presented above, I also have more projects to explore/view in the following links below. These will show my skills for Deep Learning, Big Data, Machine Learning and Data Science. I highly recommend exploring interesting models like Object Detection or Image Segmentation in TensorFlow 2.0 link as a start.

### Links to My Learning Projects:
1.	[TensorFlow 2.0](https://github.com/ylee9107/ComputerVisionTensorFlow2_myLearning) A repository consisting of my learning experience with TensorFlow 2.0.
2.	[PySpark](https://github.com/ylee9107/PySpark_myLearning) A repository consisting of my learning experience with Apache Spark where PySpark is the Python interface.
3.	[Feature Engineering]( https://github.com/ylee9107/FeatureEngineering_myLearning) (__Updates coming soon__)A repository consisting of my learning experience with feature engineering within the dataset for Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.
4.	[Tableau](https://github.com/ylee9107/Visual-Analytics-Project-1-footballResults) A project to show my ability to use Tableau as a data visualisation tool. 
5. 	[Interpretable Machine Learning](Coming Soon) A project where I explore and learn on concepts of interpretability, explain ability and transparency of ML models.

## Future works:
-	Interpretable Machine Learning, my current priority on self-learning. 
- 	Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
-	Learn Deep Learning with Facebook’s Torch (PyTorch programming)
-	Deep Learning for video processing.
